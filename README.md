Hi, Iâ€™m @Arben-Sear (he/him).  Based in Utah, 20-something.

I'm a CS undergrad, and like many CS undergrads, I'm not quite sure what I want to do in the broad field of computing.
It's likely something in software development.  I enjoy "crunchy" problems, ones that require me to think it over for a while.

I'll shamelessly admit to being a furry, but I won't meow at you or bite your ankle.

I'm a typical nerd: Dungeons and Dragons, Magic: the Gathering, etc.
